## Wire Apps - e-commerce mobile app (Shoe Store)

This document provides a detailed overview of the technical aspects of this React Expo App.

**Tech Stack:**

* **React Expo SDK 51:** This project utilizes React Expo SDK 51 for building a cross-platform mobile application (iOS and Android) using React and JavaScript. Expo provides a streamlined development environment with built-in tools and libraries for a faster development experience.

* **Expo Routing:** Expo routing is implemented for managing navigation within the app. This allows for defining different screens and transitions between them.

* **Redux Toolkit:** Redux Toolkit is used for state management in the application. It simplifies the setup and usage of Redux, a popular state management library, by providing utilities and abstractions like reducers, slices, and actions.

* **Tailwind CSS + NativeWind:** Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach to styling React components. It offers a comprehensive set of pre-defined classes for layout, typography, colors, and more. NativeWind integrates Tailwind CSS seamlessly within Expo projects, allowing for easy styling of your application's UI.

* **Jest:** Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework used for unit and integration testing of the application's components and logic.
